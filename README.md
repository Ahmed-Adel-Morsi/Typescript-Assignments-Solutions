## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

### Installation (Optional)

If you want to install TypeScript and ts-node globally or locally:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g typescript ts-node

# Or install locally in the project
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node @types/node
```

### Running an Assignment

1. **Navigate to the assignment folder:**

   ```bash
   cd "From 01 to 11 lessons Assignments/Assignment-2"
   ```

2. **Run using ts-node (Recommended):**

   ```bash
   npx ts-node index.ts
   ```

   Or if installed globally:

   ```bash
   ts-node index.ts
   ```

3. **Or compile and run:**

   ```bash
   # Compile TypeScript
   npx tsc index.ts

   # Run the compiled JavaScript
   node index.js
   ```

### Special Cases

- **Assignment-1 (Lessons 01-11):** The main file is located at:

  ```
  project/files/typescript/main.ts
  ```

- **Assignments with tsconfig.json:** Some assignments have their own `tsconfig.json`. You can compile using:

  ```bash
  npx tsc
  ```

- **Pre-compiled files:** Some assignments already have compiled `.js` files. You can run them directly:
  ```bash
  node index.js
  ```

- File paths contain spaces, so always wrap them in quotes when using terminal commands.
- Some assignments include compiled JavaScript files (`.js`) alongside TypeScript files (`.ts`).
